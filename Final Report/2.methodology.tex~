\section{Project management approach}
The project methodology followed in this project was using a spiral model. This model used included requirements analysis, design, implementation, and evaluation phases. These phases

For each feature produced in the visualisation a full iteration of the spiral was completed.

Because this system does not have any unit or integration tests, going ahead without a comprehenive knowledge of the core functionality would be foolish.
